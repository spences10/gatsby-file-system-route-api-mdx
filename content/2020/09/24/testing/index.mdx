These two tweets came in quick succession of each other.

I know the need to have tests as part of your codebase, it gives new
developers the confidence to make changes and be notified of any
issues with those changes by the tests that are in place.

Testing I will say is still a weakness of mine, I know the testing
trophy lots of uint tests not so many integrations tests, fewer end to
end tests and fewer still UI tests.
